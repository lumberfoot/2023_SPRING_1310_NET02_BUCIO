                When you need quality electronic kits, think first of Maxwell Scientific. Our kits will
                provide your students with a wide variety of interesting and fun projects. Remember, every
                kit comes with a teacher's manual and a packet of professionally-designed lesson plans.

                <p class="text2">
                    At the beginning of the nineteenth century, electricity and magnetism had been seen as
                    two entirely different forces. This all changed thanks to Hans Christian Oersted's lucky
                    lecture. <br>
                    Oersted had been using a strong battery in one of his lectures, and as he concluded his
                    talk he placed a current-carrying wire over a compass. To his surprise, the compass begain
                    to move quickly from the north direction to the east directon, as if it were in the presence
                    of an intense magnetic field. Oersted reversed the flow of the electric current and the
                    compass promptly began pointing west. <br>
                    As soon as Oersted announced his discovery, physicists all over Europe duplicated the
                    experiment and quickly realized that electricity and magnetism were two aspects of the
                    same force. Today we refer to this force as electromagnetism, thanks, in part, to Oersted's
                    lucky lecture.
