                <h2> Loot in Destiny </h2>
                <p>
                    A major part of the gameplay loop in Destiny is the grind for loot. This can be found in two
                    forms. The first is armor, and the second are weapons. These items can be earned in game by
                    playing any of the solo or group activities. The only difficult aspect of this system is that
                    each armor and weapon is rolled with random perks and abilities. This means you will have to
                    play a consideral amount before obtaining that perfect "godroll" that every YouTuber is going
                    crazy for! If you ever come across an item with interesting perks, feel free to inspect it over
                    at <a href="https://www.light.gg/"> light.gg</a> to see if you got lucky and found a godroll.
