                <h2> Fashion in Destiny </h2>
                <p>
                    One less thought of, but hugely important, aspect of Destiny is the fashion. Yes, the fashion!
                    Destiny is, after all, a Massive Multiplayer Online (MMO) game which means there is a lot of
                    incentive for players to try and stand out from the crowd. When you join a random fireteam
                    it is always fun to inspect the gear that other players have equipped. You can get a lot of
                    inspiration for your own fashion this way! And next time you play with your private friend
                    group you can try and compete to see who has the best fashion!

                    <a href="https://discord.com/invite/d2"> Discord</a> is another fantastic tool than any Destiny
                    players should become familiar with. It is a great place to makes friends and participate in the
                    gaming community. But above all else... it is the best place to show off your fashion!
