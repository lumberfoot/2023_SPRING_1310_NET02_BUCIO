                <p>
                    Destiny takes place in a futuristic world where the human race has long outlived their golden
                    age and now finds itself at the brink of extinction. But one day an alien lifeform, known as
                    "The Traveler," descended upon planet Earth and gave a select fiew humans the powers of light.
                    With this gift, these chosen few became known as Guardians. They are tasked with the protection
                    of Earth and it is their goal to find a way to prevent the collapse of humanity. However, it
                    is no easy task to protect an entire civilization against extraterrestrial invaders. For this
                    reason, Guardians are equipped with the latest technology and the ability to revive with the
                    help of a Ghost give to them by The Traveler.
